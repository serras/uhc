%%% Package database

%%[doesWhat doclatex
In memory database of all available packages.
Its contents are based upon
\begin{itemzie}
\item a list of package locations,
\item each holding packages,
\item with multiple versions encoded in their names.
\end{itemize}

Based on cmdline options a filtered view/selection is offered for further searching of files in
packages.
