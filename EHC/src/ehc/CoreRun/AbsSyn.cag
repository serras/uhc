AST for CoreRun, a runnable (geared towards efficiency) representation of Core.

It is not the intention to define AG semantics over this AST because non AG supported types (like array) are used.

Global assumptions:
- everything usually accessed by a key via a map now is done via an array
- A-normal form, i.e. arguments by name
